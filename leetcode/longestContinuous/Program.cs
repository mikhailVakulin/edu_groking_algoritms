// Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (i.e. subarray). The subsequence must be strictly increasing.

// A continuous increasing subsequence is defined by two indices l and r (l < r) such that it is [nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]] and for each l <= i < r, nums[i] < nums[i + 1].



// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
// Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
// 4.
